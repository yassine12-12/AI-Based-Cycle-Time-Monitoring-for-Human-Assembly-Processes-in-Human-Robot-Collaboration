## üéØ Project Overview

![Workstation Setup](images/arbeitsstation.jpeg)

This project develops an AI-based system for monitoring and analyzing cycle times in human assembly processes, specifically designed for human-robot collaboration (HRC) environments. The system combines computer vision, deep learning, and real-time analysis to automatically track assembly tasks performed by humans working alongside Universal Robot UR5.

### üéØ Motivation

In modern manufacturing systems, human-robot collaboration (HRC) is gaining increasing importance as it combines the flexibility of human workers with the precision and endurance of robotic systems. In such work environments, monitoring and optimizing human activities is a central factor for increasing productivity and ensuring high quality standards. A key metric in this context is the so-called cycle time - the time span required to execute a defined process step.

Traditionally, cycle time recording in manual assembly processes is carried out using sensor-based tracking systems, which are often associated with considerable installation and maintenance effort. With the increasing use of AI-based perception systems in combination with cameras, new possibilities are opening up for automated cycle time monitoring - even in dynamic and collaborative work environments.

### üî¨ Research Objectives

- **Literature research and requirements analysis** for HRC environments
- **Object detection** using custom YOLO model for assembly components
- **Human pose estimation** using MediaPipe for movement tracking
- **Automatic segmentation** of assembly phases (grasping, joining, screwing)
- **Cycle time calculation** per step using event-based triggering
- **Testing and validation** in real-world industrial scenarios
